# s21_matrix++

The enhancement of the School21 Matrix+ project.

## General information

The idea is to get familiar with classes in C++ by implementing a Matrix class.

This implementation extends the original task:

* it is template-based;
* it accepts only arithmetic types;

## Tech details

Tested on the Ubuntu 22.04 Jelly Fish LTS.

* `sudo apt install build-essential` - C/C++ and other compilers
* `sudo apt install make`
* `sudo apt install clang-format`
* `sudo apt install lcov` - coverage
